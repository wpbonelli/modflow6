"""
Tests the MAW CONNECTION_STATUS period setting, which activates and deactivates
an individual well-to-cell connection during a simulation.

A single well is screened over all three layers of the model. Connection data is
specified for the full extent of the well, and individual connections are turned
off and on in later stress periods.

Cases:
  - maw_cs_plug     : the deepest connection is deactivated part way through the
                      simulation and reactivated later, as for a backplugged well.
  - maw_cs_deepen   : the deepest connection is inactive from the start and is
                      activated later, as for a deepened well.
  - maw_cs_override : a connection is deactivated, then the whole well is made
                      INACTIVE and ACTIVE again; the connection must still be
                      inactive afterwards.
  - maw_cs_constant : as maw_cs_override, with the well made CONSTANT instead
                      of ACTIVE.
  - maw_cs_restore  : a connection is reactivated while the well is INACTIVE;
                      it must flow once the well is made ACTIVE again.
  - maw_cs_bottom   : the well bottom is raised to the bottom of the middle
                      connection while the deepest connection is deactivated in
                      the same period; BOTTOM is listed first and the result must
                      match the same settings in the opposite order.
  - maw_cs_noop     : every connection is explicitly ACTIVE, which must give the
                      same results as a model with no CONNECTION_STATUS setting.

Separate tests check that making every connection of a well INACTIVE is an
error, since STATUS INACTIVE is used to deactivate a well, that a BOTTOM above
the head or above the screen bottom of an active connection is an error, also
when the connection is reactivated after the bottom was raised (xfail), and
that raising BOTTOM above an existing HEAD_LIMIT gives the head limit warning.
