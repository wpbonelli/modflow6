Update files in this modflow6 repository according to release information.

This script is used to update several files in the modflow6 repository, including:

  ../version.txt
  ../meson.build
  ../utils/mf5to6/meson.build
  ../doc/version.tex
  ../README.md
  ../DISCLAIMER.md
  ../code.json
  ../src/Utilities/version.f90.in
  ../src/Utilities/version.f90
  ../doc/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes.tex

Information in these files include version number (major.minor.patch[label]), build
timestamp, whether or not the release is preliminary/provisional or official/approved,
whether the source code should be compiled in develop mode (IDEVELOPMODE = 1) or for
release, and other metadata.

The version number is read from ../version.txt, which contains major, minor, and patch
version numbers, and an optional label. Version numbers are substituted into source
code, latex files, markdown files, etc. The version number can be provided explicitly
using --version, short -v.

If --releasemode is provided, IDEVELOPMODE is set to 0 in src/Utilities/version.f90.in
and src/Utilities/version.f90. Otherwise, IDEVELOPMODE is set to 1.

if --releasemode is provided, the disclaimer in src/Utilities/version.f90.in and the
README/DISCLAIMER markdown files is modified to reflect review and approval.
Otherwise the language reflects preliminary/provisional status.

For a release version (i.e. not a pre-release or development version), a row is added
to the release history table in ReleaseNotes.tex if there isn't one for the version
already. The row's date is today's date unless --date is provided. The DOI is taken
from --doi if provided, otherwise from the latest release with the same major and
minor version (patch releases keep the DOI of the minor release they patch). The DOI
of a new minor or major release must be provided, either via --doi or by adding the
row manually before running this script.

Update version information stored in version.txt in the project root,
as well as several other files in the repository:

  ../version.txt
  ../meson.build
  ../utils/mf5to6/meson.build
  ../doc/version.tex
  ../README.md
  ../DISCLAIMER.md
  ../code.json
  ../src/Utilities/version.f90.in
  ../src/Utilities/version.f90

These include a combination of version strings, build timestamps, disclaimer
text, text indicating whether the release is provisional or approved, source
code setting the variable IDEVELOPMODE to either 0 or 1, and other data.

Provide a `--version` string following semantic versioning conventions.
If none of --version, --release or --post-release is provided, the version
number will not be changed, just timestamps.

Use `--release` (`-r`) to use the current development version with any
development segment (e.g. '.dev0') removed. Use `--post-release` (`-p`) to
use the next development version, with the minor version incremented and a
'.dev0' suffix re-added; this is the version the post-release reset sets on
the develop branch.

Use `--get` (`-g`) or `--dry-run` to print the resolved version without
making changes. The resolved version is printed on the last line in every
mode, so `--post-release` alone both updates the files and reports the new
version.

Use `--releasemode` to control whether IDEVELOPMODE is set to 0 instead
of 1, and to alter mf6's output and disclaimer text reflecting approval.

Use `--citation` (`-c`) to render the current software citation. Pass the
release DOI link via `--doi` (`-d`), e.g.
`--doi https://doi.org/10.5066/P1PGE9XW`; if omitted, the umbrella MODFLOW
software DOI is used.

When updating to a release version (not a pre-release or development version),
a row for the version is added to the release history table in ReleaseNotes.tex
unless it already has one. The row is dated today, or `--date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
if provided. A patch release uses the DOI of the previous release with the same
major and minor version. A new minor or major release needs `--doi`, unless its
row was added to ReleaseNotes.tex beforehand.
